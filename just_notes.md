# Spotify Clone

guess this is just a react application with no backend but just the api talking

probably created using npxd create-react-app


uses many dependencies first need to resolve that

main being spotify-web-api-js


invalid url error faced due to localhost link

fix: add it to the spotify api which will be accessed
